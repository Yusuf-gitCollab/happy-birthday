            <p>Bro...I love spending time with you guys and trust you a lot. I know I am 
                a bit emotionally demanding and a little bit of an overthinker. But that's just 
                because of my past. Par tum hamesha samajh hi jaate ho ki mujhe kab bura lar raha hai
                aur kab acha. I don't know how you do it. 
            </p>
            <p> Ali I trust you a lot. So please don't break my trust. 🤞 And the only thing I would 
                ask you for is YOU and your presence. At last many returns of the day and 
                be my <span> bestie forever</span>. 💕 
            </p>
